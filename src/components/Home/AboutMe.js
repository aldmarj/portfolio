            <p>I am a recent computer science graduate, who is currently pursuing educational and professional opportunities to find my niche in this ever-growing industry. My current focus is web development. Recently I have been exploring the capabilities of the JAMstack. The possibilities excite me due to its flexibility, extensibility and its reach. I seek out opportunities that allow me to harness the power of microservices that can come together on a web application and solve real world problems.</p>
