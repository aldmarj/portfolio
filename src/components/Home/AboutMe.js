            </header>
            <p>A highly motivated Computer Science graduate, I am eager to learn and excited by the prospect of a challenge.
I spend my free time learning new technologies that will broaden my scope and developing my personal and professional network. You will find me exploring the outdoors via bicycle and going bouldering with friends. I desire to work with a team towards a goal we are passionate about.
